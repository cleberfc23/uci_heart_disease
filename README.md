This project showcases the creation of fully interactive data visualizations integrated into web pages using Dash, enabling the development of dynamic and intuitive dashboards. 
The application implements callbacks to provide interactive forms, greatly enhancing functionality and allowing users to explore the data in a customized way. 
In addition, the system incorporates a Machine Learning model capable of generating classification predictions based on the provided data, making the dashboard not only informative but also predictive.

The project structure includes a functional navigation menu that organizes multiple integrated pages within the dashboard, ensuring a smooth and well-structured user experience. 
To keep the code clean and maintainable, the entire project follows Python best practices, with directories and modules organized according to their responsibilities.

Finally, the project is prepared for deployment using Google Cloud, making the dashboard accessible online and ready for real-world use.
